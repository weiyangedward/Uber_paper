/data:
	1) DEGsets for hb, mm, and sb. They are prefixed by species ID (mm = mouse, sb = stickleback, and hb = honeybee), an underscore, their region (mouse: A = amygdala, FC = frontal cortex, H = hypothalamus; stickleback: D = diencephalon, T = telencephalon; honeybee: MB = mushroom body), their time point after social challenge (30 = 30 minutes, 60 = 60 minutes, 120 = 120 minutes), and whether they 
	are up or down in challenged animals compared to control.

		a) negative control for DEG enrichment analysis. Random sample the same amount of genes from universe, and redo the enridchment analysis. The result should be roughly uniformly distributed. 

	2) OrthGroups for hb, mm, and sb. They are many-to-many mappings.

	3) Enrichment test on ortholog strength of each pair of DEG between two spes will be using data in this dir.

	4) UniverseGene for hb, mm and sb
