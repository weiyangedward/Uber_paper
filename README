/data:
	1) DEGsets for hb, mm, and sb. They are prefixed by species ID (mm = mouse, sb = stickleback, and hb = honeybee), an underscore, their region (mouse: A = amygdala, FC = frontal cortex, H = hypothalamus; stickleback: D = diencephalon, T = telencephalon; honeybee: MB = mushroom body), their time point after social challenge (30 = 30 minutes, 60 = 60 minutes, 120 = 120 minutes), and whether they are up or down in challenged animals compared to control.
	2) OrthGroups for hb, mm, and sb. They are many-to-many mappings.
	3) Enrichment test on ortholog strength of each pair of DEG between two spes will be using data in this dir.
